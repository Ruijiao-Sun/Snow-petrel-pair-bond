These folders include JAGS and R code for running our multi-state capture-mark-recapture models, the corresponding model outputs, and the code to generate the figures.

Folder list:

    (1) State_averaged_rates: A baseline JAGS model to estimate vital rates and pair-bond disruption probabilities that are not state-dependent.
    (2) State_dependent_rates: A baseline JAGS model to estimate state-dependent vital rates and pair-bond disruption probabilities.
    (3) ENV_W_S: A JAGS model to test the effects of winter sea ice area on widowhood and survival probabilities.
    (4) ENV_BS: A JAGS model to test how environmental conditions during the breeding season affect breeding success.
    (5) ENV_divorce: A JAGS model to test the "Direct effects" hypothesis.
